'''
OpenCV comes with a data file, letter-recognition.data

If you open it, you will see 20000 lines which may, on first sight, look like garbage.
Actually, in each row, first column is an alphabet which is our label.
Next 16 numbers following it are its different features.
These features are obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

There are 20000 samples available, so we take first 10000 data as training samples
and remaining 10000 as test samples.
We should change the alphabets to ascii characters because we canâ€™t work with alphabets directly.
